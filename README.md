1. Run ``ESM2_Finetune.ipynb`` step by step to get ``ESM2_finetuend_predictions.csv``


2. Run ``Ensemble_Model.ipynb`` step by step to get ``Ensemble_Model_Predictions.csv``


3. Run ``combine.ipynb`` to integrate the prediction results from ``ESM2_finetuend_predictions.csv`` and ``Ensemble_Model_Predictions.csv``, you will get the final prediction file ``prediction.csv``
